      <Typography>
        This page shows how much territory your Gang controls. This statistic is listed as a percentage, which
        represents how much of the total territory you control.
        <br />
        <br />
        Every ~20 seconds, your gang has a chance to 'clash' with other gangs. Your chance to win a clash depends on
        your gang's power, which is listed in the display below. Your gang's power slowly accumulates over time. The
        accumulation rate is determined by the stats of all Gang members you have assigned to the 'Territory Warfare'
        task. Gang members that are not assigned to this task do not contribute to your gang's power. Your gang also
        loses a small amount of power whenever you lose a clash.
        <br />
        <br />
        NOTE: Gang members assigned to 'Territory Warfare' can be killed during clashes. This can happen regardless of
        whether you win or lose the clash. A gang member being killed results in both respect and power loss for your
        gang.
        <br />
        <br />
        The amount of territory you have affects all aspects of your Gang members' production, including money, respect,
        and wanted level. It is very beneficial to have high territory control.
        <br />
        <br />
        To increase your chances of winning territory assign gang members to "Territory Warfare", this will build your
        gang power. Then enable "Engage in Territory Warfare" to start fighting over territory.
