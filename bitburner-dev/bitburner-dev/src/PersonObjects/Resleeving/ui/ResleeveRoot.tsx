        Re-sleeving is the process of digitizing and transferring your consciousness into a new human body, or 'sleeve'.
        Here at VitaLife, you can purchase new specially-engineered bodies for the re-sleeve process. Many of these
        bodies even come with genetic and cybernetic Augmentations!
        <br />
        <br />
        Re-sleeving will change your experience for every stat. It will also REMOVE all of your currently-installed
        Augmentations, and replace them with the ones provided by the purchased sleeve. However, Augmentations that you
        have purchased but not installed will NOT be removed. If you have purchased an Augmentation and then re-sleeve
        into a body which already has that Augmentation, it will be removed (since you cannot have duplicate
        Augmentations).
        <br />
